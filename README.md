# LangCompiler

A simple compiler for an educational procedural programming language.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Basic types: `int`, `bool`, `char`, `real`, `string`, pointers
- Functions and procedures
- Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`
- Pointers with `&` and `*`
- Nested code blocks and scope

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This language is designed for educational purposes. It demonstrates how a basic procedural language is structured and can serve as the basis for:

- Writing a parser
- Building a lexer/tokenizer
- Creating an interpreter or compiler backend

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **C** â€“ Core programming language used to implement the compiler logic.
- **Lex (Flex)** â€“ A lexical analyzer to tokenize the input source code.
- **Yacc (Bison)** â€“ A parser generator used to build the syntax analyzer.

## ðŸ“š Example Code

```text
def _main_():
var
  type int:x;
begin
  x = 5;
end

```
